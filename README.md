# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms---Solved-Problems-

This repository is part of my structured preparation for competitive programming and technical interviews.

**Plan & Commitment:**

1.Solving 1–2 DSA problems daily

2.Focus on understanding core concepts and problem-solving patterns

3.Problems categorized by topic and difficulty

4.Daily code push to maintain consistency and track progress

5.Preparation timeline: January 11th → July 31st

**Objective:**
To build strong fundamentals in Data Structures and Algorithms through consistent practice, clean implementations, and logical thinking—aligned with exam and placement preparation.
